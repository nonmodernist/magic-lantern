# Magic Lantern ü™Ñ

*Intelligent research toolkit for film historians working with the Media History Digital Library*

Automate your archival research across historical film trade publications with smart search, relevance scoring, and progress tracking.

---

## The Problem

Researching film history in trade publications means:
- Manually searching dozens of magazines across decades  
- Losing track of what you've already found
- Missing relevant coverage because titles vary
- Copying citations and quotes by hand
- No systematic way to prioritize sources

## The Solution

Magic Lantern transforms your research workflow:

**Before Magic Lantern:**
```
üìñ Open Lantern website
üîç Search "Gone with the Wind" 
üìù Manually copy 50+ results
üîç Search "Mitchell + GWTW"
üìù Copy more results (with duplicates)
üòµ Repeat for 121 films...
```

**After Magic Lantern:**
```
‚ö° Run: node magic-lantern.js
‚òï Get coffee while it searches intelligently
üìä Review interactive dashboard 
üìã Export bibliography with one click
```

## Features

üìà **Progress Dashboard** - Visual research status tracking  
üìö **Bibliography Export** - One-click citation generation  
üîç **Gap Analysis** - Identifies films needing more research  
‚ö° **Batch Processing** - Handles entire film corpora  

### Future Enhancements

‚ú® **Intelligent Multi-Strategy Search** - Tries multiple search approaches per film  
üìä **Smart Relevance Scoring** - Prioritizes reviews > production news > mentions  
üéØ **Duplicate Detection** - Finds the best version of each source 

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
# 2. Download Magic Lantern
git clone https://github.com/nonmodernist/magic-lantern.git
cd magic-lantern

# 3. Add your film data (CSV or JSON)
cp examples/sample-films.csv your-films.csv

# 4. Run the magic
node magic-lantern.js

# 5. Open the dashboard
open reports/research-dashboard.html
```

## Who This Is For

üìö **Film Historians** researching trade publication coverage  
üéì **Graduate Students** doing systematic archival research  
üíª **Digital Humanists** working with historical periodicals  
üé¨ **Film Scholars** studying industry discourse and reception  

## Ideal Example Output

Magic Lantern finds sources like this:

```
üì∞ Variety - 1939-12-15 [Score: 9.5/10]
"Gone with the Wind surpasses every expectation... Selznick has created 
a picture that will be talked about for years to come."
‚Üí Type: Film review | üìà Box office data included
‚Üí View: https://archive.org/stream/variety137-1940-01/page/n54

üé¨ Motion Picture Herald - 1939-12-16 [Score: 8.8/10]  
"Tremendous advance booking indicates Gone with the Wind will break
all attendance records..."
‚Üí Type: Production news | üìä Exhibition data
‚Üí View: https://archive.org/stream/motionpictureher...
```

## What Makes It Smart

üß† **Context-Aware Scoring**: Prioritizes contemporary reviews over mere mentions  
üéØ **Source Quality Detection**: Variety > trade papers > fan magazines  
üìÖ **Temporal Relevance**: Weighs sources closer to release date higher  
üîÑ **Adaptive Search**: Tries multiple search strategies automatically

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Film metadata** in CSV, JSON, or markdown format
- **Internet connection** for API calls to MHDL

### Installation

1. **Download Magic Lantern**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nonmodernist/magic-lantern.git
   cd magic-lantern
   ```

2. **No additional dependencies needed!** Magic Lantern uses only Node.js built-in modules.

3. **Prepare your film data** (see [Configuration](#configuration) below)

4. **Run your first search**
   ```bash
   node magic-lantern.js
   ```

## Configuration  

Magic Lantern can work with various film metadata formats:

### CSV Format (Recommended)
```csv
Title,Year,Director,Author
"Gone with the Wind",1939,"Victor Fleming","Margaret Mitchell"
"Giant",1956,"George Stevens","Edna Ferber"
```

### JSON Format
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Gone with the Wind",
    "year": 1939,
    "director": "Victor Fleming", 
    "author": "Margaret Mitchell"
  }
]
```

### Markdown/Zola Format
Magic Lantern can also read from markdown files with frontmatter (perfect for static site generators).

### Advanced Configuration

Create a `config.json` file to customize behavior:

```json
{
  "searchStrategies": ["title_author", "title_year", "title_director"],
  "publicationPriority": {
    "variety": 10,
    "motion picture herald": 9,
    "photoplay": 7
  },
  "dateRange": 3,
  "outputFormat": "chicago"
}
```

## Examples

### Academic Research Project
```bash
# Research 1950s melodramas
node magic-lantern.js --input melodramas.csv --date-range 5
```

### Dissertation Chapter
```bash
# Focus on specific publications
node magic-lantern.js --publications "variety,motion picture herald" 
```

### Quick Faculty Research
```bash
# Test with just a few films first
node magic-lantern.js --limit 5 --verbose
```

## API Reference

### Command Line Options
- `--input <file>` - Specify input file (default: films.csv)
- `--output <dir>` - Output directory (default: reports/)
- `--limit <num>` - Process only first N films (for testing)
- `--date-range <years>` - Search window around release date
- `--publications <list>` - Comma-separated publication filter
- `--verbose` - Detailed logging
- `--help` - Show all options

### File Formats

Magic Lantern exports to multiple formats:
- **HTML Dashboard** - Interactive research overview
- **JSON** - Raw data for further analysis  
- **CSV** - Spreadsheet-compatible results
- **BibTeX** - For citation managers
- **Chicago/MLA** - Formatted citations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No films found"**
- Check your CSV headers match expected format
- Ensure file path is correct
- Try `--verbose` flag for detailed logging

**"API rate limit exceeded"**  
- Magic Lantern automatically respects MHDL's 10-request/second limit
- For large datasets, expect longer run times

**"Empty search results"**
- Some films may have limited trade coverage
- Try broader date ranges with `--date-range 5`
- Check film title spelling against MHDL collection
