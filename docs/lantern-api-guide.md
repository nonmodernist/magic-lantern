# Lantern API Access

Lantern now includes basic functionality to interact programmatically with search queries, results, and individual item details. By making a `GET` request to a specific URL, you can retrieve information about MHDL collection items in a structured JSON format.

This is very basic functionality based on Blacklight's [implementation of JSON-API](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/JSON-API). We do not provide any additional API access beyond these very basic requests. Additionally, we do not provide official support for accessing Lantern via these methods.

## Access Limits and Restrictions

Requesting data in JSON format via these endpoints does not require prior authorization. You are welcome to use these URLs within your own scripts to work programmatically with the MHDL collections. However, please be mindful that automated use may impact the experience for other users. To that end, we ask that you please limit your requests to no more than 10 requests/second. We believe that this strikes an appropriate balance between providing enhanced scripted access to the Lantern search and ensuring that the general public can still access the MHDL holdings as expected.

If you have a project in mind that will necessitate exceeding this rate limit, please get in touch with us at mhdl@commarts.wisc.edu to discuss your plans.

## Other API Access to the MHDL Collections

Lantern is designed to provide full-text search of every scanned page within the MHDL collection. Before building an application that interacts with these API endpoints, it may be worth considering whether this is the best means for you to access the MHDL holdings. If you need to search the actual text content and work with individual pages, then using Lantern is probably your best option. But if you just need to search broadly across the collections and work with whole volumes (e.g. full magazines, pressbooks, trade journals) then it may be more useful for you to use the [MHDL Collection](https://archive.org/details/mediahistory) on the Internet Archive and use [their APIs](https://archive.org/services/docs/api/) instead.

## Queries

To perform and automated Lantern query, make a `GET` request to `http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog.json?q=QUERY+TEXT+HERE`.

Use the `?q=` parameter to specify your query. Don't forget to URL encode any special characters within your request to avoid errors.

Lantern will return a JSON response with your search results. The response will contain several sections:

- Links
    - Search results are paginated, and you can use the values in the links section to request next page(s) in your search results.
    
    ```
    "links": {
	"self": "http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog.json?q=QUERY+TEXT+HERE",
	"next": "http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog.json?page=2&q=QUERY+TEXT+HERE",
	"last": "http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog.json?page=56661&q=QUERY+TEXT+HERE"
    },

    ```

    - Self: represents the current URL that you requested
    - Next: represents the URL to request the next page of results.
    - Last: represents the URL to request the last page of results

- Meta

    - Provides metadata about the number of pages of search results that are available for you to request.

    ```"meta": {
        "pages": {
            "current_page": 1,
            "next_page": 2,
            "prev_page": null,
            "total_pages": 56661,
            "limit_value": 10,
            "offset_value": 0,
            "total_count": 566606,
            "first_page?": true,
            "last_page?": false
        }
    },
    ```

    - Contains the actual search results and basic attributes (similar to what is displayed on the HTML results page)
    - id: use the id field to request full details about a specific page using the "Item Details" endpoint
    - attributes: contains further values (and URLs) to access on Internet Archive or via the Lantern interface
    - body: Displays the brief excerpt from the OCR text that matched the search query

- Included
    - Facets
        - Returns information about the search facets that are available for the returned search query. This can be useful for retrieving metadata such as the number of results that match a particular year, for example.
    - Sort
        - Returns information about the available sort methods for the search query. You can use the returned links to make a new request with the search results sorted in a particular way

### Creating Queries

All of the facets (e.g. date, title, author, publisher, etc.) that are available on the website interface are available to use when creating an API query. These can be added as URL parameters within the HTTP GET request that your application sends to the server.

One easy way to create your request URL is to first use the website interface to fine-tune the search query and facets that you'd like to use. Then, you can copy the URL and add `.json` after `https://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/...` so that it now reads `https://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog.json/...`. You can use this URL within your application to parse the raw search results for the query that you created.

## Item Details

To retrieve information about a specific page, make a `GET` request to `https://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/PAGE_ID/raw.json`.

Replace PAGE_ID with the id of an individual item, which you can find using the "Queries" API endpoint outlined above.

Lantern will return a JSON response with full information about the specified page. Of particular interest may be the `body` attribute, which will include the raw OCR text of the particular page. This may be useful for interacting with the text scans in an automated fashion
