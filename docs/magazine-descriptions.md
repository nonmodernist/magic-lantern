# MHDL Descriptions

## Top 40

### Photoplay
The leading Hollywood fan magazine of the 1920s and 1930s. Photoplay offered readers portraits of their favorite movie stars and stories about their personal lives. The magazine played an important promotional function for the Hollywood industry, but its editors and reviewers could also be highly critical of Hollywood. Beginning in 1921, Photoplay bestowed its annual 'Medal of Honor' for the film readers voted as the best of the year.


### Moving Picture World

Moving Picture World, founded in 1907 by J.P. Chalmers, was one of the motion picture industry's first trade papers. Published on a weekly basis in New York City, Moving Picture World informed exhibitors about films available for rental and editorialized on behalf of the growing industry (improving the quality of movies through higher filmmaking standards, not government censorship, was a frequent topic). The paper reached its height in the mid-to-late-1910s--a fact reflected in the circulation figures and the huge amount of advertising that filled every issue during the period. In the 1920s, Moving Picture World lost ground to other competing weekly trade papers -- including Variety, Exhibitor's Herald, and Motion Picture News. In 1927, Moving Picture World ceased publication when it was acquired by Martin Quigley's Exhibitor's Herald. Across the 20 year run of Moving Picture World, readers can watch the transition from short film programs to feature films and witness the transition from the dominance of Edison's Trust to the rise of the "Independent" film companies that ultimately became the Hollywood studios. Silent film historians have utilized and cited Moving Picture World more frequently than any other trade paper, and the publication still has many insights left to offer. 


### Motion Picture News

Motion Picture News was the leading film industry trade journal during the 1920s. Founded in 1908 as a counterweight to the dominant Moving Picture World, the News was the voice for the independent, non-Trust, producers. Later Motion Picture News expanded its coverage to the entire industry, supporting the independent exhibitor with objective film reviews, summaries of programs at theatres across the nation, activities of regional exchanges in the cities with regional exchanges, and excellent coverage of the coming of sound and screenings and stage shots at the major New York City theatres. 


### Wid's Daily / The Film Daily

This leading industry publication, published out of New York, was founded in 1915 by Wid Gunning (who called his publication Wid's Daily until 1922). The Film Daily documented the rise of the Hollywood studios, the transition to sound, and the evolution of the American film industry (the paper finally shuttered in 1970). The Film Daily included feature reviews, news stories, and advertisements, but its extensive coverage of short films in the 1920s and 30s distinguished it from other trade papers of the period.


### Exhibitors Herald

Founded in 1915 by a Chicago printing company as a regional trade paper for Midwest exhibitors. In 1916, editor Martin Quigley bought out the owners, and over the next 15 years, he grew EXHIBITORS HERALD into one of the most important national, weekly trade papers in the film business. Quigley acquired MOTOGRAPHY in 1917 and MOVING PICTURE WORLD in 1927. In 1930, he acquired MOTION PICTURE NEWS and the new 'consolidated' publication became MOTION PICTURE HERALD. From the pulpit of his editorial page, Quigley preached the need to improve the motion picture industry and improve the quality of the films. He skillfully served as a mediator in disputes -- between distributors and exhibitors, between the film industry and the Catholic Church (Quigley was one of the architects of the Production Code). Quigley claimed that EXHIBITORS HERALD represented the 'independent exhibitor' and sections like 'What the Picture Did for Me?' certainly provided a forum for theater owners. But plenty of exhibitors viewed Quigley as a servant to the studios and large theater chains. In response, publications such as SHOWMEN'S TRADE REVIEW, INDEPENDENT EXHIBITORS FILM BULLETIN, HARRISON'S REPORTS, and BOX OFFICE were either formed or grew significantly in the years following Quigley's brief moment of consolidation in 1930.

### Variety

Founded in 1905 by Sime Silverman, Variety is the best known and most important trade paper in the history of American entertainment. Variety began as a New York weekly publication covering vaudeville, however, its scope expanded over time to include legitimate theatre, burlesque, motion pictures, radio, and television (transitions that the MHDL will eventually document within this record). In 1933, Daily Variety was launched in Los Angeles to offer in-depth coverage of the motion picture industry and serve as a competitor to The Hollywood Reporter, which was founded 'on the Coast' in 1930. In March 2013, Variety's owner ended the print edition of Daily Variety, though as of this writing, the weekly publication and a website offering non-stop news updates still exist. Variety may ultimately be best remembered for its integration of show business slang into entertainment trade coverage. Boffo. Hokum. Quickies. Svelte. Climaxer. Tenpercenter. Coastlander. Skein. We're still feeling zowied.


### Motion Picture Daily

A New York-based daily trade paper published by Martin Quigley. The companion to Quigley's better known weekly publication, MOTION PICTURE HERALD, and a direct competitor to THE FILM DAILY, which was also published out of New York. Established in 1930, MOTION PICTURE DAILY enjoyed a circulation of roughly 5,000 readers most years of its four decades in print (a nearly identical circulation to THE FILM DAILY, but only one third of the readership of MOTION PICTURE HERALD, which reached a wider audience of exhibitors). In the 1930s, the MOTION PICTURE DAILY's editor, Maurice Kann, called on the movie industry to shift more production back to the East Coast. Any productions that filmed in New York received ample attention. New York City never regained its production lead over Hollywood, but the major studios used the Big Apple for their corporate and distribution headquarters. As a result, MOTION PICTURE DAILY tended to focus on economic and regulatory issues confronting the film industry.


### Broadcasting

This trade paper began in 1931 with a focus on radio, but as the TV industry expanded in the post-World War II era, the paper increasingly became devoted to television (even the title changed to BROADCASTING TELECASTING). Developments in technology, policy, advertising, and programming were covered. The paper's advertisements and articles reveal the intricate relationship among sponsors, stations, program suppliers, and station representatives -- the industry's term for middle-men who represented numerous local stations in negotiations with national sponsors. The success of particular stations or programming choices are frequently trumpeted in BROADCASTING'S advertisements -- always with the goal of selling more of something, such as a film program or a station's spot advertising time. 


### Sponsor

Subtitle varies: The Buyers of broadcast advertising; The weekly magazine TV/radio advertisers use; the national weekly of TV & radio advertising


### Radio Mirror

Radio Mirror (later known as Radio and Television Mirror) was a fan magazine for radio listeners and later TV viewers that includes profiles of the stars, visits to radio and television studios, and program listings. The early years in the 1930s show the interaction of motion pictures, recordings, the stage, radio and even politics. The role of radio in World War II is well covered in the 1940s, and by the 1950s the focus shifts to television and a new generation of personalities.


### Picture-Play Magazine

Began publishing in 1915; mid-level fan magazine on par with Movie Classic and Screenland. Cost a twenty five cents an issue up until pricing pressure from New Movie (c. 1932) incited an across-the-board price decrease to 10 cents. Merged with Charm in 1941, which would later become Glamour magazine (1959). 


### Radio Age

Originally Motion Picture Classic (first issue 1915), renamed Movie Classic in September 1931. Sold as 'The Newsreel of the Newstands'; on par with Picture Play and Screenland in terms of content, quality, and circulation (solid but below that of Photoplay, et. al.) until it was absorbed by Motion Picture in 1937.


### Movie Makers

Movie Makers, the official publication of the Amateur Cinema League, documented and championed home movies and production by local film clubs. During 27 years of publication, Movie Makers provided extensive coverage of the growth of 16mm, the availability of Hollywood films to the home, filmmaking style, amateur production, and color cinematography.


### New York Clipper

The New York Clipper was one of the first theatrical trade newspapers in the United States. Founded in 1853, the Clipper offered weekly coverage of legitimate theatre, vaudeville, the circus, and other forms of entertainment (which, by the early-20th century, included motion pictures). In 1923, the Clipper was acquired and absorbed by one of its New York competitors: Variety.


### Exhibitor's Trade Review

In late-1916, Exhibitor's Trade Review entered a crowded market of weekly motion picture trade publications that already included the Moving Picture World, Motion Picture News, Exhibitor's Herald, and Motography, along with theatre and vaudeville-oriented papers that covered film, such as Variety, the Billboard, and the New York Clipper. To gain market share and differentiate itself from competitors, Exhibitor's Trade Review pursued a variety of tactics -- some constructive (gathering allies among exhibitor organizations), others destructive (smearing the reputations of competing trade papers and certain film companies that refused to buy advertising). Despite the behind-the-scenes controversies, though, Exhibitor's Trade Review appears to have, in the words of Alan Gevinson, 'established itself legitimately in its role as advisor to and fighter for the independent exhibitor.' All the issues that mattered to independent exhibitors were covered, including censorship, taxes, distributor contracts, piano accompaniment, and, of course, the films. In 1926, Exhibitor's Trade Review ceased weekly publication and only offered the daily service, Exhibitor's Daily, which was acquired a few years later by Martin Quigley as he attempted to consolidate the industry's trade papers under his control. 

### BOXOFFICE

BOXOFFICE was the leading American exhibitor trade paper of the post-World War II era. But the publication had modest beginnings. In 1920, Ben Shlyen founded the paper, orginally titled THE REEL JOURNAL, in an office located in Kansas City's Film Row district. Like other regional exhibitor publications, THE REEL JOURNAL focused its attention on the local -- in this case, KC and the nearby territories that the city's distribution exchanges served. By the end of the 1920s, however, Shlyen had acquired or founded several more small exhibitor papers serving other US markets. In 1932, their titles all changed to BOXOFFICE, though they continued to be published in regional editions for decades to follow. 


### Showmen's Trade Review

Established in 1933 by Charles 'Chick' Lewis, who previously edited the 'Manager's Round Table' section in Quigley's MOTION PICTURE HERALD. Lewis originally called his new publication SHOWMEN'S ROUND TABLE, but after a lawsuit from Quigley, he changed the title to SHOWMEN'S TRADE REVIEW (STR). Over the next two decades, STR proved to be a formidable competitor to Quigley's HERALD and steadily grew in circulation. It's easy to see why exhibitors wanted to subscribe. STR's editorial voice, reviews of features and shorts, 'Box Office Slant' tips for how to promote movies, and concise and well organized 'Booking Guides' made it a trustworthy and highly useful magazine for exhibitors. 


### International Projectionist

International Projectionist presented the technology of cinema sound and image projection while addressing the issues and concerns of union projectionists.


### Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers

The Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers (SMPE)Êdocuments the technological progress of the film industry, highlighting technical developments in production and exhibition. Of special interest are articles about special effects, theater practices, lighting, and the introduction of the 16mm format. Initially titled "Transactions of the Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers."


## Other titles

Paramount and Artcraft Press Books
Paramount Press Books
Paramount Pep
Paramount Pep-O-Grams
Film Fun

### The Exhibitor

Regional trade paper that began in Philadelphia, but expanded to include editions for other markets.

### Close Up

As an active film magazine, CLOSE UP lasted only a short time, from 1927 to 1933. Yet the legacy of this English-language periodical, which was published in Switzerland, continues to matter. Edited by Bryher and her husband Kenneth Macpherson, CLOSE UP became THE magazine for energetic debates about the nature of cinema and manifestos imagining new forms of filmmaking and spectatorship. The magazine published articles by filmmakers, such as Sergei Eisenstein, and female literary modernists, such as H.D. and Gertrude Stein. As film scholar Anne Friedberg explains in the anthology CLOSE-UP, 1927-1933: CINEMA & MODERNISM, 'CLOSE UP became the model for a certain type of writing about film -- writing that was theoretically astute, politically incisive, critical of films that were simply 'entertainment.' For six and a half years, CLOSE UP maintained a forum for a broad variety of ideas about the cinema; it never advocated a single direction of development, but rather posed alternatives to existing modes of production, consumption, and film style.' Like Friedberg's own writing, CLOSE UP continues to be essential reading for anyone interested in the history of film and media theory.

### The Optical Magic Lantern Journal

1889 - 1903

### Universal Weekly

The organ of the Universal Film Manufacturing Company. Previously titled MOVING PICTURE WEEKLY.

### Cine-Mundial

Description (English): Cine-Mundial, the Spanish-language version of Moving Picture World, was published between 1916 and 1948. The magazine documents Hollywoodâs growing dominance in Latin American markets in the 1920s and the emergence of national film industries, such as those of Mexico and Argentina after the introduction of sound film. Far from being a mere translation of its English-language counterpart, Cine-Mundial focused on issues that were important to its readers in Latin American and Spainâthe representation of Latin Americans on screen, the geo-politics of film distribution, and Hollywoodâs short foray into Spanish-language film production in the late 1920 and early 1930s. Functioning as both trade publication and fan magazine, its regular columns that featured reports from national correspondents and letters from readers from every corner of the Spanish-speaking world provides invaluable insight into Latin American audiences and their reception of both imported and nationally or regionally produced films. 


### Harrison's Reports

'A reviewing service free from the influence of film advertising... devoted chiefly to the interests of the exhibitors.' From 1919 to 1962, HARRISON'S REPORTS served as a watchdog for the interests of U.S. independent movie theaters. Founder and editor P.S. Harrison used his 4-page sheet (occasionally 8-pages) to praise films that he considered good for theaters and audiences and to excoriate bad pictures, 'immoral' theater operators, films on 16mm and TV, and any company or policy that made life more difficult for exhibitors.


### Independent Exhibitors Film Bulletin

East Coast exhibitor publication. Founded in 1934 by the Independent Exhibitors' Protective Association in response to the perceived shortcomings of Motion Picture Herald and the Motion Picture Theatre Owners (MPTO). Served as a news source, reviewing service, and forum for independent exhibitors to share their many grievances.


### Inside Facts of Stage and Screen

### The Edison phonograph monthly
Reprint, with an introduction added, of a periodical published 1903-1916


### The New Movie Magazine

Relatively short-lived magazine that nonetheless played a crucial role in the gossip industry. Launched in 1929, it cost only ten cents, when the majority of high-end magazines sold for a quarter. It was also primarily sold through Woolworthâs five and dime stores; the combination of cost and accessibility led to its dominance, by 1933, over all other magazines (circulation: 650,000). As a result, the other magazines decreased their price to match New Movieâs. New Movie had less content and poorer quality drawings and illustrations, but the content similar in tone and quality to that of the high end magazines. Ceased publication in 1935.


## Other info


### Hollywood Studio System Collection

Trade papers like Boxoffice, Showmen’s Trade Review and Motion Picture Herald addressed exhibitors, as did the studios themselves through publications that promoted their films and stars (e.g., 20th Century-Fox Dynamo, Biographies of Universal Stars and Featured Players, Who's Who at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer). The studios also created internal publications for their large workforce of studio employees, as seen in Action and Fox Folks. Professional associations and guilds that represented various industry professions created their own publications for members, including the American Society of Cinematographers’ American Cinematographer, the Society of Motion Picture Art Directors’ Production Designer, and the Screen Writers’ Guild’s The Screenwriter.

The Hollywood Studio System collection also includes an extensive run of The Film Daily, a leading motion picture trade paper published out of New York that reached participants involved in all aspects of the movie business. The Film Daily includes news reports from throughout the industry, occasional features stories, hundreds of full-page ads, and innumerable reviews of features and shorts. Harrison’s Reports also offered film reviews to exhibitors and billed itself as a "reviewing service free from the influence of film advertising." Also in this collection are fan magazines like Photoplay, Picture-Play Magazine, and Screenland, Hollywood biographies and memoirs like The Private Life of Greta Garbo, Behind The Screen by movie mogul Sam Goldwyn, and Confessions of an Actor by John Barrymore, as well as early editions of the still-active Variety and Hollywood Reporter.


### Fan Magazine Collection

Fan magazines gave audiences a way to experience the magic of the movies beyond the theater. The magazines also gave producers a way to promote their films and their stars. You can see a shift in emphasis from the former to latter across the historical span of this collection. Whereas the volumes of Motion Picture Story Magazine (1913-1914) and the British Picture Stories Magazine (1915) reproduced film stories, the fan magazines of the late-teens and beyond focused on the most important audience draw: the stars.

Our own greatest draw in this collection is our five decade run of Photoplay. Scanned from the original color magazines, the MHDL’s collection of Photoplay begins in 1916 and extends through 1963. By 1918, Photoplay had a circulation of over 200,000 readers, and it was the dominant fan magazine of the 1920s and 30s. Its glossy coverage of stars—including through photographs, interviews, and advice purportedly “written” by the stars themselves—was foundational for the type of celebrity culture we continue to live in today, though the gossip published in Photoplay was relatively tame. Many of its articles (and advertisements) were directed at women, indicating the importance of female moviegoers to the industry in this period.

### Pressbooks Collection

Pressbooks were created by distributors to promote their films in local markets. Sent directly to movie theaters, pressbooks provided promotional materials and suggested strategies for local exhibitors to bring people into the theater and maximize profits for both parties.

The digitized pressbooks in this collection date from the 1910s through the 1970s. Represented are major studios Warner Bros., MGM, 20th Century-Fox, Columbia, and United Artists, as well as several independent distributors. Early on, pressbooks were relatively short, providing information and pre-written articles about the film that exhibitors could send to their local newspapers to print. By the 1930s and 40s, the number of pages and methods of promotion had exploded. The pressbooks in this period usually included sections for publicity, advertisements, lobby displays and other decorations, as well as ideas for promotional stunts. The large publicity sections included pre-written articles and photographs for local newspapers to reprint in advance of a film’s premiere and additional material and reviews to run while the film was actually showing. These publicity sections could include multiple options for short, middle, and feature-length stories. Some pressbooks included material for the local newspaper’s Women’s Section, often to do with the female star and her film fashions.

Some pressbooks also included “fictionalizations,” essentially multi-part summaries of a film's plot in serialized newspaper form. Promotion did not stop at the newspaper, however. Pressbooks also sometimes included radio sketches for local stations to air, and pressbooks for musicals sold records with songs from the film for theaters to purchase and play. They also sold posters and accessories for theaters to decorate their lobbies and fronts with, including life-size cutouts of actors and stars. Particularly unique to this era of film publicity were the ideas for “exploitation” or “ballyhoo”—promotional stunts for theaters to put on for a given film. These ideas often included contests in various forms, but also parades or floats, collaborations with other local establishments like themed window displays, and dramatic lobby exhibits. One particularly dramatic suggestion for such an exhibit can be found in the pressbook for United Artists’ Hell’s Angels, which suggests that exhibitors ask their local airfield to arrange to display a full-sized airplane on top of their theater marquee—reminding them to first get permission from their building inspection department, of course, due to the plane’s weight.

After the collapse of the studio system, in the 1950s, pressbooks shifted back to a smaller size, mainly comprised of advertisements and short articles. The large collection of pressbooks here documents this shift and the heyday of ballyhoo and stunt publicity. In addition to the lighthearted nature of these over-the-top promotions, however, these pressbooks also shine a light on the darker side of this period in film history. Several of the pressbooks contained in this collection include indefensibly racist and sexist content, including representations of black- and brownface. Please see the description for Kid Millions for a discussion of why these materials are included in the collection, rather than erased or ignored. Through these pressbooks, we see the complex, contradictory nature—alternately light-hearted and morally reprehensible—of this period of film distribution, promotion and exhibition.

### Yearbooks Collection

In the film industry, Year Books or annuals, documented the accomplishments and participants in specific industries. The Year Books for the motion picture industry are especially important to historians because of their organization and perspective on the trade. For each year, the Year Books catalog films released, highlight events, provide comprehensive listings of industry companies and personnel, reprint company financial statements, and contain evocative advertisements from industry suppliers, vendors, producers, stars, and directors.

If magazines are the day-to-day history of the media industries, then Year Books follow that progress with a more objective perspective, while still looking at the industry as an inside player. Year Books such as Kinematograph and Film Daily showcase a variety of sections such as “Who’s What in the Industry” and vendor indexes for items like crystal chandeliers and seat covers. Since the industry trade magazines published the Year Books, there was a tacit understanding that the purchasing of advertising would help ensure that no negative coverage would appear and

Of the hundreds of available volumes, this collection includes a representative sample across five decades (1916-1964). The best known of these is The Film Daily Year Book, published out of New York, which served as an in-depth look at production and distribution. A highlight of this collection is a listing of every theater in the United States. The market was large enough that The Film Daily also published a Directors Guide in the 1930s. The main competitor was Quigley Publications' Motion Picture Almanac, which is represented in this collection by two examples, one in 1929 and the other from 1937-1938.

In an attempt to match these publications, in the 1940s, The Hollywood Reporter created The Hollywood Reporter Production Encyclopedia. Although credits were limited to the most recent five years, their contribution was notable for its focus on television and detailed cast and credits. Their credits included many names for production managers and assistant directors that did not appear on screen and can only be found through printed resources such as these.

While this collection does have numerous Year Books on Hollywood’s industry, it also houses Year Books from Great Britain, Canada, and Japan. Kine Year Book documents Great Britain’s vibrant yet small industry, and the Cinema Year Book of Japan presents the phases and films of the Japanese movie industry to a new audience in the 1930s.

Within this collection, it is important to note that there are two subcategories of Year Books - booking guides and studio directories. Booking guides helped exhibitors select films for their theaters and often provided indexes to reviews in the affiliated magazine. Studio directories served to remind casting directors and others of performers under contract and freelance supporting players. In the present, these Year Books provide scholars with a deeper and more detailed exploration of the inner workings of the film industry. The unique documentation of Year Books allows us to flip through the pages of these often forgotten names, films, and practices, in order to learn and remember.


### Monogram Pressbooks

Monogram Pressbooks in the Media History Digital Library - https://mediahistoryproject.org/projects/monogram.php
There are 73 Monogram Pictures pressbooks digititized and available online to browse and read in the Media History Digital Library. We are proud to be able to share promotional materials from across a wide range of the studio's history. The earliest pressbook is from 1937, and the most recent was published in 1949. By looking across the studio's history, we can start to see some interesting trends in the number of pressbooks published each year, as well as some minor fluctuations in how long each of these pressbooks were.
