Double-coated.  Two  layers  of  sensitive silver. \n2.  Highly  color-sensitive. \n3.  Halation  \"fuzz\"  prevented   by  special backing  on  film. \n4.  Finer  details   in   both    high    lights   and shadows. \n5.  Translucent,  instead    of  transparent. \nMade  by  an  exclusive  process  of Eastman  Kodak  Co.,  Rochester,  N.  Y. \nKODAK \nERICHROME \nFILM \nLittle  Women  Contest \nTHE  March  issue  of  New  Movie offered  six  awards  for  the  best  letters on  why  its  readers  packed  the theaters  of  America  to  see  \"Little Women.\"  Here  are  the  winning  letters, as  selected  by  the  contest  judges: \nFirst  Prize — $50 \nIF  the  opportunity  came  to  revisit my  grandmother  and  her  beloved cookie  jar  and  singing  teakettle,  I'd rejoice. \nJust  so — when  \"Little  Women\"  came to  the  screen,  I  HAD  to  renew  my friendship  with  these  dear  companions of  my  youth.  I  love  them  just  as  I love  the  memory  of  my  grandmother. I  didn't  go  to  see  Katharine  Hepburn. I  went  to  see  \"Jo.\"  I  came  away dreamily  content.  By  happy  fortune, the  producers  had  symbolized  my  old friends — not  made  the  characters  symbolize the  stars.  My  treasured  memory is  sweetly  intensified — not  disillusioned— a  rare  thing  in  the  movies. Mrs.  D.  S.  Campbell 1661  Sacramento  St.,  Apt.  5 \nSan   Francisco,    Calif. \nSecond  Pri \n-$10 \nT  WENT  to  see  \"Little  Women\"  be-1 cause  I  knew  that  no  matter  how much  the  story  was  torn  down  in picturization,  there  must  still  remain the  clean,  sweet  home-life  of  the  early sixties. \nThe  public  is  surfeited  with  slush, sexuality,  and  booze  guzzling,  as  is evidenced  by  the  box-office  receipts  of \"Little  Women.\" \nThe  bubble  has  burst;  we  have  come down  to  earth;  we  are  groping  for something  substantial.  And  the  sooner the  picture  industry  realizes  this fact,  the  sooner  it  will  again  establish  its   prestige. \nMrs.    Vida    B.    Butcher \n107  South  St., Ocononcowoc,    Wisconsin \nThird  Prize — $10 \nWE    did    not    see    \"Little    Women\" because   of  its   cast;   neither   did its   merited   fame   impel   us. \nWe  went  because  we  knew  of  no more  eloquent  and  effective  way  of appealing  for  clean  pictures;  because we  wanted  to  prove  the  number  of  us attracted  by  the  filthy  innuendos  so shamefully  characteristic  of  many  pictures today  is  grossly  exaggerated; because  we  appreciate  delicacy  and reserve  in  pictorial  display  of  human passions;  and  because  we  had  waited a  long  while  for  a  picture  to  which we  could  take  mother  and  sister  and daughter    without   fear    of   embarrass\nment   or    consequences    even    more    regrettable. \nSamuel    R.    Blanken 4206  14th  Street,  N.  W., \nWashington,   D.   C. \nFourth    Prize — $10 \nTHE  overwhelming  success  of \"Little  Women\"  was  due  to  its being  released  at  an  opportune  time. With  the  general  depression  people have  become  more  serious-minded  and the  movies  instead  of  simply  being  a \"fill-in,\"  have  become  the  sole  entertainment of  many.  Weary  of  vulgarity and  sensationalism,  American audiences  welcomed  the  simple  story  of the  immortal  March  family.  We  have had  an  overdose  of  unwholesome  pictures. Producers,  by  making  each production  an  exceptional  one,  would find  an  appreciative  public — what proof?  Witness — \"Little  Women.\" ( Miss )  E.  Rogers 111  Midland  Ave., Arlington,  N.  J. \nFifth   Prize— $10 \nTHE  American  movie  audiences  are intelligent,  and  are  about  tired  of the  types  of  pictures  offered  recently. Too    much     of    the    sex,    burlesque, musical-comedy   themes,    following   the also  overdone  racketeer  pictures. \n\"Little  Women\"  came  as  a  pleasant surprise;  it  brought  to  us  of  this complex  age,  a  glimpse  of  the  refreshing life  of  an  unhurried  era. \nIt  was  so  real,  clean  and  appealing, and  delightfully  portrayed  by an  ideally  chosen   cast. \nSeeing  \"Little  Women\"  was  like going  from  the  noisy  bedlam  of  city streets,  into  a  lovely  garden. \nJean     Leach 13    Newport    St., Wilkes-Barre,    Pa. \nSixth   Prize— $10 \nI  HAVE  read  \"Little  Women\"  many times,  each  time  with  greater  pleasure. I  hoped  for  a  long  time  to see  it  on  the  screen. \nI  did  not  go  especially  to  see  Miss Hepburn,  though  I  knew  I  should enjoy  her  as  Jo,  the  boyish,  impulsive character  everyone  loves. \nNor  did  I  go  simply  because  of  the fame   of    Miss    Alcott's   book. \nI  wanted  to  see  nice  plain  people living  wholesome,  uneventful  lives  in their  own  way. \nLives     can     be     interesting    without teaming    SIN,    SEX    and    MONEY.

But  it  remained for  the  readers  of  Photoplay— the  motion  picture  audience of  the  world — to  put  the  full  and final  seal  of  \"the  best\"  on  it. \nPhotoplay's  review  of  the  picture (in  the  January  number)  reads: \".  .  .  The  story  could  not  have been  lived  out  in  real  life  more  realistically than  we  see  it  portrayed  on the  screen.\"  And,  further  along, \".  .  .  Whatever  your  taste  in  pictures, you  will  feel  its  charm,  .  .  . because  this  picture  is  a  genuine masterpiece  .  .  .\" \nPhotoplay  listed  the  picture  the best  of  the  month,  and  gave  Katharine Hepburn  and  Paul  Lukas  top positions  for  the  best  performances \n32 \nM.   H.    Aylesworth,   the   president  of \nRKO-Radio,    whose    insight   into    the \nworth  of  Louisa  M.  Alcott's  book  gave \nus  \"Little  Women\" \nThe  little  women  themselves  and their  mother,  easily  recognized: Katharine  Hepburn  as  Jo,  Spring Byington  as  Marmee,  Jean  Parker as  Beth,  Joan  Bennett  as  Amy, Frances  Dee  as  Meg \nout  of  six  leading  pictures  for  the month.  Incidentally,  Miss  Hepburn was  chosen  by  the  Motion Picture  Academy  of  Arts  and Sciences  as  the  best  actress  for 1933. \nBut,  there  was  something  else  to \"Little    Women\"    besides    acting. \nIt  was  the  story.  The  story  was of  simpler  days,  when  people  smiled. It  brought  memories — happy  ones. It  portrayed  four  girls,  their  overburdened mother,  a  father  in  the army,  poverty  in  a  post-war  world, cheerfulness  and  the  comicalities  in trying  to  make  both  ends  meet, with  a  smile,  and  kindly  neighbors. People  saw  themselves  as  they wished  they  were. \nAnother  factor,  \"  Little  Women\" came  out  when  this  country  was prostrated  by  a  shortage  of  work and  money,  even  more  so  than  now, and  with  nowhere  to  turn  for  relief. \n",

Its emotional  release  eased  Everyman's  and  Everywoman's  burdens.  It  was  good  medicine,  needed and  timely. \nThe  reaction  to  the  picture  was  so  great,  newspapers filled  columns  with  comment  about  it.    Long editorials  were  composed  anent  the  reason  or  reasons for  this  widespread  public  reaction  to  such an  old,  old  story  of  post-Civil  War days.     In  fact,  the  editor  of  a New  York  newspaper,  watching the  reaction,  felt  at  long last  his  readers  were  fed  up with  sex  and  crime,  and that   the  pendulum  had swung  to  the  other  extreme.

It  is \na  masterpiece  of  Tiffany,  two-and-one-half \ninches  in  diameter,  and  is  the  most  coveted \nannual  award  of  Filmdom \nserial  rights.     His  directors  said  his  circulation would  fall  off,  the  paper  would  lose  money.     It was  just  the  reverse — the  circulation  went  up  and the  paper  made  money. \nAll  this  was  due  to  the  power  of  the  motion  picture, \"Little  Women.\" \nNaturally,  without  the  capabilities  of  the  scenarists, director,  cast,  and  cameraman,  the  full  power that  is  in  \"Little  Women\"  could  not  have  been  felt. Nor  would  the  worth  while  purpose  it  served  have been  possible  if  RKO-Radio,  the  producing  company, had  not  had  the  timely  insight into  what  the  public needed.  It  is  an  enduring  monument to  M.  H.  Aylesworth, president  of  the  Radio-KeithOrpheum  Corporation  and  chairman of  the  board  of  RKO-Radio Pictures,  Inc.  And  the  production reflects  great  credit  upon Merian  C.  Cooper,  the  producer, and  Kenneth  MacGowan,  associate producer. \nThe  balloting  which  has  given \"Little  Women\"  the  Photoplay Gold  Medal  has  emphasized  the great  and  universal  delight  the movie-going  public  has  found  in the  picture.
