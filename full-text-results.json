      "fullText": "5° \nMary  Pickford  repeats  her  \"Stella  Maris\"  achievement  in  \"Amarilly  of Clothesline  Alley.\" \nThe  portraits  in  \"  Ruggles  of  Red  Gap \"  are  well  done,  by  Taylor Holmes  as  Ruggles,  Frederick  Burton  as  Cousin  Egbert,  and  others. \nIrene  Castle  is  charming  as  ever  in  \"The  Hillcrest  Mystery\"  though she  deserves  greater  acting  roles. \nPhotoplay  Magazine \nWith  these  five  exceptions,  I  defy  the  supermoralists  of America,  the  most  intense  Puritans,  yes,  even  the  prudes, to  examine  the  films  of  the  month,  so  far  as  they  have been  viewed  at  this  writing,  and  find  any  reason  for  the existence  of  censorship.  Pictures  are  being  emancipated, not  by  rule  of  thumb,  but  by  reason  of  a  growing  realization among  producers  that  they  can  entertain  their  public to  their  own  greatest  profit,  by  presenting  drama  that  is not  robbed  of  its  true  power  by  indulgence  in  nauseating sensation. \nAMARILLY  OF  CLOTHESLINE  ALLEY— Artcraft \nMary  Pickford  follows  her  remarkable  \"Stella  Maris\" with  another  character  study  scarcely  less  remarkable, Amarilly  Jenkins  in  \"Amarilly  of  Clothesline  Alley.\"  The role  is  midway  between  the  hopelessly  tragic  slavey  in \"Stella  Maris\"  and  the  pathetically  optimistic  Stella  herself. Amarilly  is  happy  with  the  happiness  of  the  alley child,  than  which  there  is  nothing  more  buoyant  nor  so swiftly  and  suddenly  attacked  by  woe.  Hers  is  the  merry heart  of  the  Irish  girl,  which  needs  so  little  sunshine  because it  is  a  little  sun  in  itself.  Nor  is  there  the  customary sop  to  the  romanticists,  or  garbing  Amarilly  in satins  at  the  end  and  marrying  her  to  the  millionaire;  she blithely  turns  down  the  rich  man  and  marries  her  bartender sweetheart.  And  why  not?  Bartenders  are  always total  abstainers.  All  this  is  done  in  Mary  Pickford's blithest  vein,  reminding  us  once  more  that  she  is  the greatest  of  all  screen  actresses. \nHUCK  AND  TOM— Paramount \n\"There  comes  a  time  in  the  life  of  every  well-constructed boy  when  he  is  overcome  by  a  raging  desire  to  dig  for hidden  treasure.\"  This  is  the  kernel  of  \"Huck  and  Tom,\" a  sequel  to  \"Tom  Sawyer,\"  made  from  the  second  of  the Mark  Twain  books  of  boyhood.  The  story  is  not  so fascinating,  being  an  unbelievable  mixture  of  boyish  fancy and  Brady  melodrama.  Jack  Pickford,  Robert  Gordon and  Clara  Horton  bear  the  brunt  of  the  task  of  making it  seem  real. \nLA  TOSC A— Paramount \nGive  Pauline  Frederick  a  role  that  is  worthy  of  her,  and she  is  pretty  nearly  the  greatest  actress  in  moving  pictures. In  \"La  Tosca\"  she  sweeps  you  from  emotion  to  emotion with  all  the  force  of  a  personified  tempest.  The  coquette, the  jealous  woman,  the  despairing  woman,  the  woman who  takes  a  terrible  revenge  for  an  awful  deed  and  finally goes  to  her  own  death,  epically  tragic — all  these  moods are  understood  and  personified  by  Miss  Frederick  in  one of  the  greatest  works  of  her  entire  career.  It  is  a  problem to  get  a  play  big  enough  for  this  great  artist.  \"La  Tosca,\" with  all  its  trickeries  of  plot,  is  such  a  role,  for  it  was big  enough  for  Bernhardt,  who  was,  in  fact,  Sardou's  model as  he  wrote.  Frank  Losee  is  Scarpia  and  Jules  Raucourt Mario.  Edward  Jose  directed,  and  handled  the  difficult torture  scene  with  the  utmost  delicacy,  using  suggestion almost  entirely  to  tell  the  fearful  story.  This  is  great drama,  the  kind  of  drama  the  screen  needs  and  for  which it  is  clamoring.  It  is  not  an  entertainment  for  children, but  it  is  the  sort  of  play  and  the  sort  of  acting  that  both the  stage  and  the  screen  must  have  if  they  are  to  be  anything but  soothing  syrup  for  the  kindergarten. \nTHE  GIRL  AND  THE  JUDGE— Mutual \nClyde  Fitch's  play,  \"The  Girl  and  the  Judge,\"  done for  the  screen  with  Olive  Tell  as  the  girl  and  David Powell  as  the  judge,  gains  little  and  loses  much  by  its expansion  of  incident  from  the  Fitch  version.     Yet  it  is \n",

      "fullText": "The  Screen  in  Review \n265 \nMary  Pickford  in  \"Amarilly  of  Clothesline Alley.\" \nto-be-forgotten  \"Broncho  Billy\"  pictures, if  for  no  other  reason  than  to show  the  advancement  of  the  art  of picture  producing  since  they  were  made. The^  picturegoer  has  been  educated  to subtler  things  than  six  flashes  of Broncho  Billy  dashing  along  a  road  on horseback — six  successive  flashes.  But to  my  mind  these  single-reelers  are  as funny  as  Mack  Sennett  at  his  best,  if Essanay  will  forgive  me  for  saying  so. \"Broncho  Billy's  Leap\"  strongly  appealed to  my  sense  of  humor,  particularly when  G.  M.  Anderson  endeavored to  express  emotion  in  the  very  face  of the  lens.  But  with  the  more  perfect examples  of  the  motion  picture  to  consider, let  us  leave  Broncho  Billy  galloping along  that  distant  road  and  turn to  \n\"Amarilly  of  Clothesline  Alley\" \n(Artcraft) \nThis  is  Mary  Pickford's  latest,  and it  contrasts  strongly  with  that  highly dramatic  subject,  \"Stella  Maris.''*  It \nAnn  Pennington  in  \"Sunshine Man:' \nis  almost  entirely  in  humorous  vein, though  there  are  times  when  one catches  a  glimpse  of  pathos  in  the  character of  Amarilly.  But  there  are  more laughs  than  tears.  Amarilly  is  a  tough little  Irish  specimen  who,  through  a  series of  startling  circumstances,  is  introduced into  the  home  of  an  ultrarich society  woman.  All  the  wealth  and good  clothes  that  are  showered  upon her,  however,  change  not  her  heart,  and she  refuses  the  fashionable  artist  for Terry  McGowan,  her  old  sweetheart, who  wears  a  white  apron  and  works  on the  sober  side  of  the  bar  in  an  East Side  cafe.  .  Perhaps  the  funniest  scenes are  current  when  Amarilly' s  mother  and brothers  and  sisters  come  to  visit  her in  her  new  home.  '  Kate  Price  as  the maternal  parent,  Irish  as  peat,  is  more than  likely  to  send  her  audience  into convulsions  when  she  comes  in  contact with  the  absurdly  effete.  The  picture is  an  adaptation  from  a  novel  by  Belle K.  Maniates,  but  that  matters  little,  as much  of  the  action  has  been  changed \n",
