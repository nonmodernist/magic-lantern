In  addition  the studios  and  archives  have  collaborated  in  promoting  screenings  of  studiopreserved  titles  such  as  The  Bridge  on  the  River  Kwai  (1957),  Gone  with  the Wind  (1939),  and  The  Wizard  of  Oz  (1939),  and  thus  furthering  public interest  in  preservation  and  increasing  the  audience  for  restored  films. \nWhy  Prepare  Voluntary  Guidelines? \nThe  Public-Private  Cooperation  Task  Force,  appointed  by  the  Librarian of  Congress  to  advise  on  the  national  film  preservation  plan,  has  developed the  following  voluntary  guidelines  to  assist  interested  studios  and  archives  in developing  constructive  partnerships.   The  guidelines  draw  upon  task  force members'  experiences  over  the  past  decade  in  joint  restoration  ventures  and summarize  key  features  contributing  to  successful  efforts.    The  guidelines suggest  an  informal  framework  for  designing  mutually  beneficial collaborations  and  can  be  applied  to  single  projects  or  ongoing  programs. \nBenefits  of  Cooperative  Restoration  Projects \nBy  pooling  resources  and  expertise  to  preserve  major  studio-owned titles,  a  studio  and  a  public  archive  can  produce  high-quality  preservation materials,  adding  to  a  film's  long-term  commercial  value  and  supporting  the role  of  archives  in  safeguarding  America's  film  heritage. \nThe  studio  specifically: \n•  Obtains  advice  in  determining  which  films  are  of  considerable cultural  interest  to  the  American  film-viewing  public  and  worth  the investment  of  a  full-scale  restoration. \n•  Develops  a  clear  framework  for  preservation  planning  and prioritization. \n•  Obtains  detailed  research  on  key  titles  and  evaluations  of  the preservation  quality  of  film  materials  in  its  library. \n•  Ensures  that  the  best-available  materials-from  both  commercial and  public  collections -are  used  in  the  restoration  process. \n44        Redefining  Film  Preservation \n",

      "fullText": "100 \nHARRISON'S  REPORTS \nJune  18,  1949 \ntical  business  men,  and  the  hope  was  expressed  that the  producers  will  find  it  expedient  one  day  to  engage a  well  known,  practical  business  figure  to  guide  their association  and  thus  straighten  out  its  muddled  affairs. \nSince  that  editorial  was  written  the  MPAA  leaders, specifically  Mr.  Johnston  and  Mr.  Harmon,  have  dem' onstrated,  not  once,  but  twice,  their  ineptitude  in dealing  with  at  least  one  important  problem — that  of uniting  the  exhibitors  and  producer-distributors  in  an industrywide  program  for  better  public  relations,  as well  as  intra-industry  relations. \nThe  first  \"boner\"  was  pulled  on  June  8,  when  Har' mon,  in  his  first  move  as  new  head  of  the  association's trade  relations  department,  invited  Gael  Sullivan, Ted  Gamble,  and  Robert  W.  Coyne,  top  leaders  of the  Theatre  Owners  of  America,  the  membership  of which  is  composed  mainly  of  affiliated  theatres,  to meet  with  him  and  Mr.  Johnston  in  Washington  for what  was  termed  as  an  \"exploratory\"  discussion  on closer  liaison  between  the  different  branches  of  the industry  on  trade  problems,  and  on  public  relations. \nAccording  to  trade  paper  reports,  Harmon  hoped to  keep  the  meeting  as  quiet  as  possible,  but  the  TOA leaders  saw  no  need  for  secrecy,  and  before  long  the news  leaked  out  and  was  published.  Some  of  the  trade paper  stories  stated  that  the  Allied  leaders  were  displeased because  no  invitation  had  been  extended  to them,  while  another  report,  in  weekly  Variety,  stated that  the  Allied  leaders  had  been  invited  but  were peeved  because  it  was  a  last-minute  invitation  that seemed  to  them  to  be  an  afterthought. \nThe  second  \"boner\"  was  pulled  this  week,  when another  meeting  with  TOA  leaders  was  held  in  New York,  with  no  formal  announcement  from  the  MPAA that  such  a  meeting  was  to  be  held.  It  was  another hush-hush  affair,  and  again  it  was  a  case  of  the  news leaking  out.  As  a  result,  trade  paper  stories  of  the pending  meeting,  which  was  held  on  Wednesday, played  up  the  fact  that  the  Allied  leaders  had  again been  overlooked. \nAny  one  reading  these  trade  paper  accounts  could not  help  but  be  left  with  the  impression  that  the policy  of  secrecy  adopted  by  the  MPAA  in  connection  with  these  meetings,  as  well  as  the  fact  that  the discussions  were  being  held  exclusively  with  the TOA,  smacked  of  a  deliberate  snub  to  representa' tives  of  the  independent  exhibitors,  even  though  no complaint  had  been  voiced  by  them.  The  trade  papers, of  course,  were  reporting  the  news  as  they  saw  it. The  fact  is,  however,  that  no  snub  to  the  independent exhibitor  leaders  was  intended  or  committed,  according to  a  clear-cut  statement  issued  by  Ned  E.  Depinet, president  of  RKO  and  chairman  of  the  MPAA's  Exhibitor-Community Relations  Committee,  who  presided at  the  New  York  meeting. \nMr.  Depinet  made  it  clear  that  the  discussion  with the  TOA  leaders  was  the  first  in  a  series  of  meetings to  be  held  with  representatives  of  all  branches  of  the industry,  including  all  exhibitor  organisations,  for the  purpose  of  weighing  \"the  wisdom  of  an  early  effort to  unite  all  industry  segments  to  the  consideration of  common  problems  in  the  field  of  general  industry business,  intra-industry  affairs  and  public  relations.\" No  definite  program  had  been  decided  on  other  than to  probe  the  attitudes  of  other  industry  groups  with a  view  to  engendering  their  participation,  stated  Mr. Depinet.  He  pointed  out  that  invitations  for  other such  meetings  had  been  extended  to  National  Allied, PCCITO,  ITO  of  New  York,  Metropolitan  MPT  A, Hollywood  groups  and  the  trade  press. \nHarrison's  Reports  is  indeed  gratified  that  Mr. \nDepinet  has  cleared  up  a  situation  which,  because  of inept  handling  by  Messrs.  Johnston  and  Harmon, gave  many  independent  exhibitors  the  impression  that the  TOA  was  being  favored  over  other  industry groups.  The  idea  of  uniting  all  branches  of  the  industry for  the  betterment  of  intra-industry  and  public relations  is  a  commendable  one,  and  to  be  successful it  will  require  the  full  support  and  cooperation  of every  segment  in  the  business.  Mr.  Depinet,  a  practical businessman,  should  see  to  it  that  the  plan  is  no longer  endangered  by  the  blundering  tactics  demonstrated by  the  Messrs.  Johnston  and  Harmon  in  connection with  the  exploratory  discussions  held  with the  TOA. \n\"SOME  OF  THE  BEST\" \nIn  commemoration  of  its  twenty-fifth  birthday, Metro-Goldwyn-Maycr  has  compiled  a  Silver  Anniversary subject,  composed  of  scenes  from  MGM's important  pictures  during  the  past  twenty-five  years, including  clips  from  current  and  forthcoming  product. The  subject  has  a  running  time  of  forty  minutes  and will  be  distributed  without  charge  to  all  theatres. \nIt  is  a  highly  entertaining  film,  one  worth  exploiting, for  it  should  draw  many  customers  who  will want  to  sec  their  favorite  stars,  past  and  present,  in roles  they  made  famous.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  subject can  easily  take  the  place  of  a  second  feature  in double-billing  situations,  and  at  the  same  time  give the  customers  much  more  satisfaction. \nLionel  Barrymore  introduces  and  comments  upon the  different  sequences,  which  include  the  following: \"The  Big  Parade\"  (1924),  with  John  Gilbert  and Renee  Adoree;  \"The  Merry  Widow\"  (1925),  with John  Gilbert  and  Mae  Murray;  \"Flesh  and  the  Devil\" (1926),  with  Greta  Garbo  and  John  Gilbert;  \"Ben Hur\"  (1927),  with  Ramon  Novarro  and  Francis  X. Bushman;  \"Tell  It  To  the  Marines\"  (1928),  with Lon  Chaney,  William  Haines  and  Eleanor  Boardman; \"Broadway  Melody\"  (1929),  with  Charles  King, Bessie  Love  and  Anita  Paige;  \"Min  and  Bill\"  (1930), with  Marie  Dressier  and  Wallace  Beery ;  Trader  Horn\" ( 193 1) ,  with  Harry  Carey,  Edwina  Booth  and  Duncan Renaldo;  \"Grand  Hotel\"  (1932),  with  Greta  Garbo, John  Barrymore,  Wallace  Beery  and  Joan  Crawford; \"Tugboat  Annie\"  (1933),  with  Marie  Dressier  and Wallace  Beery;  \"Dinner  At  Eight\"  (1934),  with Jean  Harlow,  Marie  Dressier  and  other  stars;  \"Mutiny on  the  Bounty\"  (1935),  with  Clark  Gable  and Charles  Laughton;  \"San  Francisco\"  (1936),  with Clark  Gable,  Spencer  Tracy  and  Jeanette  MacDonald;  \"The  Good  Earth\"  (1937),  with  Paul  Muni  and Luise  Rainer;  \"Boys  Town\"  (1938),  with  Spencer Tracy  and  Mickey  Rooney;  \"The  Wizard  of  Oz\" (1939),  with  Judy  Garland,  Ray  Bolger  and  Jack Haley;  \"Boom  Town\"  (1940),  with  Clark  Gable  and Spencer  Tracy;  \"The  Philadelphia  Story\"  (1941), with  Cary  Grant  and  Katharine  Hepburn;  \"Mrs. Miniver\"  (1942),  with  Greer  Garson  and  Walter Pidgeon;  \"Random  Harvest\"  (1943),  with  Greer Garson  and  Ronald  Colman;  \"National  Velvet\" (1944),  with  Mickey  Rooney  and  Elisabeth  Taylor; \"Meet  Me  in  St.  Louis\"  (1945),  with  Judy  Garland and  Margaret  O'Brien;  \"The  Green  Years\"  (1946), with  Charles  Coburn  and  Dean  Stockwell;  \"The Yearling\"  (1947),  with  Claude  Jarman,  Jr.;  and \"Easter  Parade\"  (1948),  with  Judy  Garland  and  Fred Astaire.  These  are  followed  by  brief  excerpts  from current  and  forthcoming  pictures,  as  well  as  close-ups of  MGM's  entire  roster  of  stars  in  attendance  at  the studio's  Silver  Anniversary  luncheon. \n",
