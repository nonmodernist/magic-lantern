Actually, it looks like all referenced publications have patterns! But we should verify they work correctly.

## üìä Tracking Progress

Create a spreadsheet or use this markdown table:

| Publication | Weight | Pattern Exists | IA Items Found | Pattern Verified | Notes |
|------------|--------|----------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| variety | 1.5 | ‚úÖ | | | |
| harrisons reports | 1.6 | ‚úÖ | | | |
| american cinematographer | 1.8 | ‚úÖ | | | |
| boxoffice | 1.8 | ‚úÖ | | | |
| ... | | | | | |

## üéØ Quick Wins to Start

1. **Start with the highest-weight publications** that are most critical to the labor history and adaptation studies profiles
2. **Focus on publications with complex patterns** like Motion Picture World with all its variants
3. **Check publications that seem to have variants** (e.g., "The Film Daily" vs "Film Daily")
4. **Verify the "negative lookahead" patterns** work correctly (like boxoffice)
