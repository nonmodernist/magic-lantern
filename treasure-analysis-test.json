It  makes  a  good  picture, interesting  throughout,  and  absorbingly  so at  times.  That  it  will  have  wide  and  unusually  popular appeal  there  is  no  doubt.  \"Tess  of  the  Storm  Country\" possesses  the  qualities  that  make  for  success.  There is  an  abundance  of  what  is  described  as  \"heart  interest,\"  and strengthening  and  amplifying  this  most  essential  factor  are not  only  big  scenes  but  large  groups  well  handled,  situations in  which  many  men  and  women  are  so  impressed  with  the tragic  happenings  of  which  they  are  spectators  that  the  concern revealed  in  their  countenances  makes  them  seem  more like  active  participants....",

As  she   was   in   \"Caprice,\"  as \nshe  was  in  \"Hearts  Adrift.\"  so  she  is  in  \"Tess  of  the  Storm Country\" â€” inimitable,  always  doing  the  unexpected  thing, yet  always  human,  lovable;  impulsive,  her  affections  for  her father  as  deep  as  her  detestation  of  the  elder  for  whose  son there  rises  in  her  breast  the  first  springs  of  love;  religious, her  faith  in  the  God  of  whom  she  has  learned  from  her theological  student-lover  as  sure,  as  complete,  as  it  is  childlike and  convincing.  So,  too,  is  she  self-sacrificing,  assuming without  murmur  of  complaint  the  stigma  of  unwedded motherhood  to  save  the  reputation  of  the  slowly  declining sister  of  the  man  she  loved  as  she  was  also  the  daughter  of the  man  whose  hand  was  always  against  Tess  and  her people. \nGrace  Miller  White,  the  author  of  the  book,  laid  the  story by  the  shores  of  Cayuga  Lake,  which,  on  account  of  the fierceness  of  its  squalls,  is  sometimes  known  as  the  \"storm country.\"  Producer  Porter  has  staged  his  picture  on  the Pacific.  He  was  most  happy  in  his  selection  of  backgrounds. A  long  row  of  fishermen's  huts  nestling  on  the  beach  at  the foot  of  towering  cliffs  give  the  touch  of  realism  when  they are  described  to  us  as  the  homes  of  the  squatters.

It  is  a  Western  production without  a  single  Indian  to  supply  the  local  color.  The  atmosphere created  by  this  virile  photoplay  is  refreshingly  new and  the  production  owes  much  of  its  charm  and  power  to  the clever  work  of  Josephine  West  and  Joe  Ryan,  the  cowboy who  rides  anything  with  four  feet. \nMARY  PICKFORD  AS  \"TESS  OF  THE  STORM COUNTRY.\" \nThe  next  Mary  Pickford  release  of  the  Famous  Players Film  Company  is  scheduled  for  March  20.  \"Little  Mary\" will  be  presented  in  the  famous  story  of  a  woman's  heroism \"Tess  of  the  Storm  Country,\"  by  Grace  Miller  White.  The story  of  Tess,  with  her  quaint  philosophy  of  life,  humorous and  pathetic,  is  one  of  the  most  powerful  character  sketches ever  written.  Tess  is  an  elemental  type  of  womanhood,  a Ijrimitive  heart  struggling  with  modern  conditions,  and  the delicate  tortures  of  civilization.  The  theme  is  full  of  uplift, and  the  dramatic  situations  often  force  a  tear  of  which  we need  not  be  asliamed.  Mary  Pickford  as  Tess,  the  ragged little  \"squatter\"  girl,  dirty  but  beautiful,  rude,  willful,  saucy, but  no'ble  and  self-sacrificing,  renders  a  portrayal  of  inexliaustible  fascination.  As  a  photodrama  \"Tess  of  the  Storm Country\"  will  give  its  audiences  a  subject  out  of  the  beaten path,  and  numerous  thrills  mingled  with  the  sweetest  of human  traits,  compassion. \n\"Tess  of  the  Storm  Country\"  is  the  second  production  to be  made  at  the  Los  .\\ngeles  studio  of  the  Famous  Players, under  the  direction  of  Edwin  S.
